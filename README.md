# AmberWatch

I wanted to build website with elegant, luxury personality. I decided that main theme of site will be watches. Technology used in this project are HTML, SASS and JavaScript

This is the first project when I used SASS architecture, when each component, site section and variable has is dedicated folder and file. Must say that at the beggining it was a bit confusing trying to figure it out where which part of site suppose it land. But at the end I had no problem to navigate through all folders and files.

## features
* animated cards
* fully responsive

## things to improve
* functionality can be added to buttons.'
